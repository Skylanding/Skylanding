### Hey, I'm [Jaray](https://skylanding.github.io) 👋

Currently I‘m a senior major in ECE at Wuhan University.

I design and develop machine learning models, mainly for medical image segmentation, bio-signal processing, using methods involving analysis and tuning large language models (LLMs), and embedded device development. Now I am interested in AI applications in scenario construction, including autonomous driving and chip layout.
