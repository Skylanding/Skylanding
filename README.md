<!--
**Skylanding/skylanding** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

💻 I design and develop machine learning models, mainly for medical image segmentation, biological signal processing, using methods that involve analyzing and tuning large language models (LLM) and embedded device development🤖. My tools are also used to develop vision models for autonomous driving 🚗 .

🌱 I am currently a third-year student at Wuhan University.
