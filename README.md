### Hi,I'm [Jaray](https://skylanding.github.io) 👋

💻 I design and develop machine learning models, mainly for medical image segmentation, biological signal processing, using methods that involve analyzing and tuning large language models (LLM) and embedded device development🤖. Now I'm interested in AI application in EDA.
🌱 I am currently a third-year student at Wuhan University.
